# Green Digital Skills in Web Design

This repository contains some of the knowledge acquired in a [course on how to design green digital solutions](https://www.greenskills.inco-group.co/).

The world has a growing demand of green skills. Hopefully sharing what I learned here will help someone else.

### Definitions
- **Green skills:** are those that enable the environmental sustainability of economic activities.
- **Green jobs:** are those that cannot be performed without extensive knowledge of green skills.
- **Greening jobs:** can be performed without green skills, but typically require some green skills.
- **Greening Potential jobs:** can be performeed without green skills, but occasionally require some level of green skills.
- **Non-green job:** are those that do not require green skills to be performed.


### Sustainable Web Design Guidelines
- **JEDI practices:** designing for the least privileged users - if they get the best experience then everyone will also get it (e.g. reducing assets for slow connections).
- **Assets:** use media efficiently - see comments on videos and images in [this article](https://climateaction.tech/blog/how-we-improved-our-website-carbon-calculator-score-from-59-to-84/).
- **Fonts:** use system fonts that are already on the users device.
- **Dark mode:** using dark designs reduces the brightness of the screen, which means less energy is used.
- **Content with expiry date:** after serving its purpose, content should be taken down.
- **UX Performance:** to make it actionable, to reduce the amount of time people should spend on deciding which path to take.
- **Minify and combine JS and CSS**
- **Reduce tracking and advertising scripts**

### Sustainable Hosting
Digital doesn't equal green. A sustainable hosting shuold either:
- Be powered by renewable energy, or
- use carbon offsets / renewable energy credits.
